# Personal website (for now)

Made with help from Jekyll and [Gradfolio](https://jitinnair1.github.io/gradfolio/)

Tags were added with help from [this post](https://longqian.me/2017/02/09/github-jekyll-tag/)

## Inspired by:
- [hagura](https://github.com/sharu725/hagura)
- [al-folio](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio)
- [noir](https://github.com/essentialenemy/noir)
- [jekyll-TeXt-theme](https://github.com/kitian616/jekyll-TeXt-theme)

## Other things to get done:
- ~~Bring down the profile image a little. Currently looks like it is touching the horizontal bar~~
- Change the colors on the link located in-body
- Change the site icon

A lot of these demos/projects were done in R and I used <a href='https://workflowr.github.io/workflowr/' target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">workflowr</a> to organize them. Clicking on the links will take you to a workflowr-ish template. The aim is to demo some problems I encouter in computational genetics and ways I solved or made them worse. Also, this will help to measure how I am growing and learning.

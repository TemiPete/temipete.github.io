My name is Temi, and I'm a PhD student in the Genetics, Genomics and Systems Biology (<a href="https://ggsb.uchicago.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GGSB</a>) program at The University of Chicago. Prior to this, I completed a master's at The University of North Dakota, supervised by the awesome <a href="https://med.und.edu/labs/hur/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Junguk Hur</a>.

## <ins>currently</ins>

In fall 2022, I joined <a href="https://hakyimlab.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Haky's lab</a> for my PhD dissertation. Here, I will be studying variations in the human epigenome (at the genomic level and the population level), how these variations influence molecular phenotypes (e.g. TF binding), and how these, in turn, influence complex traits and diseases. These are complex/interesting questions. Wish me luck!

## <ins>thinking about</ins>
<a href="content/assets/thoughts/index.qmd" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Here's a more complete list</a>

- genetics, pharmacogenetics, machine learning, and statistical methods
- climate change + recycling
- rap, as in the music genre
- what to do after this PhD
- next random things to learn [currently doing Origami]
- becoming a good-enough cook + improving my basic knife skills [they are very poor right now]
- next DIY projects + Jugaa·∏çing when I get the opportunity
- collecting/making my own bracelets
- football, or soccer, if you are North American
- why there is so much kickback against Oxford commas [even the AP style recommended not using them until <a href="{{< var site.hrefs.oxford_commas >}}" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">very recently</a>]

## <ins>other lives</ins>
Often, I am in the gym doing bodyweight workouts. Sometimes, I'll read <a href="content/books/index.qmd" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">books</a> + <a href="{{< var site.hrefs.tv_shows >}}" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">watch TV shows</a> or <a href="https://letterboxd.com/TemiWho/films/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">movies</a>. Other times, I'll practice playing the guitar, play pick-up football, and do some DIYs for fun. 

And if I have enough time left, I'll stare outside the window for a bit, or go out and touch grass.

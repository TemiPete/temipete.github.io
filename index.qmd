My name is Temi, and I'm a PhD student in the Genetics, Genomics and Systems Biology (<a href="https://ggsb.uchicago.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GGSB</a>) program at The University of Chicago. Prior to this, I completed a master's at The University of North Dakota, supervised by the awesome <a href="https://med.und.edu/labs/hur/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Junguk Hur</a>.

## currently

In fall 2022, I joined <a href="https://hakyimlab.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Haky's lab</a> for my PhD dissertation. Here, I will be developing methods to find transcription factors that are associated with GWAS phenotypes. This is an important and interesting problem/gap in the field. Wish me luck!

## latest obsessions
- modern choral music
- taking improv classes so I can emcee later in life; I've emcee'd events before and the overwhelming jugdement was that I'm a natural
- starting swimming classes. with Boeing and its issues, who knows where I might find myself during a flight?

## passionate and vocal about
- food security. I think people should get to eat. So, I volunteer at 2 food pantries in the city. 
- football. I really love the sport.
- singing. I was a choir boy, growing up. So, it was only natural that I joined a choral ensemble, which I really love, too.

## passively thinking about
<a href="content/assets/thoughts/index.qmd" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Here's a more complete list</a>

- genetics, pharmacogenetics, machine learning, and statistical methods
- climate change + recycling
- rap, as in the music genre
- what to do after this PhD
- next random things to learn [currently doing Origami]
- cooking + improving my basic knife skills [they are very poor right now]
- next DIY projects + Jugaa·∏çing when I get the opportunity
- collecting/making my own bracelets
- why there is so much kickback against Oxford commas [even the AP style recommended not using them until <a href="{{< var site.hrefs.oxford_commas >}}" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">very recently</a>]

## other lives
Often, I am in the gym doing bodyweight workouts. Sometimes, I'll read <a href="{{< var site.hrefs.goodreads >}}" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">books</a> + <a href="{{< var site.hrefs.tv_shows >}}" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">watch TV shows</a> or <a href="https://letterboxd.com/TemiWho/films/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">movies</a>. Other times, I'll practice playing the guitar, play pick-up football, and do some DIYs for fun. 

I love inviting my friends to events especially stand-up comedy, improv, and social dancing.

And if I have enough time left, I'll stare outside the window for a bit, or go out and touch grass.

## <ins>about</ins>

My name is Temi, and I'm a PhD student in the Genetics, Genomics and Systems biology (<a href="https://ggsb.uchicago.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GGSB</a>) program at the University of Chicago. Prior to this, I completed a master's at the University of North Dakota, supervised by the awesome <a href="https://med.und.edu/labs/hur/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Junguk Hur</a>.

## <ins>thinking about</ins>

- genetics and pharmacogenetics
- deep learning and statistics
- climate change
- becoming a good-enough chef
- what to do after a PhD
- next DIY projects
- why there is so much kickback against Oxford commas

## <ins>currently</ins>

In Fall 2022, I joined <a href="https://hakyimlab.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Haky's lab</a> for my PhD thesis. Here, I will be studying variations in the human epigenome (at the genomic level and the population level), how these variations influence molecular phenotypes (e.g. TF binding), and how these, in turn, influence complex traits and diseases. These are complex/interesting questions. Wish me luck!

## <ins>some evidence</ins>
Here is my <a href="assets/cv.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cv</a> and a list of <a href="../publications" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">publications</a> that I have contributed to.

## <ins>life beyond</ins>
Sometimes, I read books. Other times, I play the guitar, football, and do some DIYs for fun. Believe me for now, but evidence coming soon.

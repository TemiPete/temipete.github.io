title: Pivoting from Pharmacology to Computational Biology
---

My research interests are subtly changing. A few years back, I did not know what computational biology was. And because I studied pharmacology, I developed interest in pharmacogenomics and precision medicine. However, the wonderful thing about the biosciences is that many fields are interwoven. Therefore, having a background in anatomy, for instance, does not stop you from pursuing graduate studies in, say, physics. Heck, this is the story of many. 

Today, I am still interested in precision medicine and understanding how individual genomes interprete medications. But I am beginning to take another route towards answering fundamental questions in this field. Herein comes computational biology; hereinafter referred to as comp bio. 

To understand how medication affect people differently, we need to know how the body sees them \[medications\]. Different elements in the body react with medications. These elements could be proteins (in most cases) or genes themselves. Genes, however, regulate/compose/dictate the forms of these elements. Therefore, the genomic makeup of an individual will determine the proteins produced and how these proteins interact with foreign substances, in this case, proteins. One field that studies the genes in terms of heritability and relationship with traits \[read: height, eye color, shape of nose, risk for heart disease, risk for developing a type of cancer, e.t.c. \], is the field of genetics \(or genomics\). There is a subtle difference between the two but we will ignore that for now. 

Thing is, it might prove difficult to study genetics without computation. I know Mendel did not need computation. But he lacked access to the amount of genetic data we have. Also, we are studying genetics in relation to hundreds of complex traits, and we realise a lot better now, that we need to step outside, and take a bird's eye-view of the entire genome. Computation helps in this case because we can faster and expansively explore correlated relationships. We can do experiments to alter biological process, sequence entire genomes, and derive causality. We can do simulations to increase our faith in a hypothesis, or a failing one. We can fail to understand what is going on in a dataset, but trust mightily in the ability of computers to show us the patterns therein. We can do a lot more. 

I have no background in the field of genetics, although I know what genes are. In fact, my first contact with closely-related-to-genetics concepts were in a molecular biology class I took during my master's degree. Recently, I have been updating myself on these concepts by reading books. 

In retrospect, I feel that the past two years of my life have been spent learning computation &mdash; and some biology. But to be honest, a lot more computation. Today, I feel that I have a good grasp of computing concepts and some coding languages, well enough to begin a structured form of self-learning. Oh! My learning journey has, largely, been random. I took online lessons and read books and practiced. But I did not learn to program from, well, "The beginning". "The beginning" would refer to learning about data structures and algorithms, and learning about operating systems. This is the next phase of my journey. 

Did I mention that I don't have a math background? I think I have to properly learn calculus and linear algebra. I have some ideas and can do some matrix multiplication and all that, but I know the subject is a lot more complex, and I have to learn these complexities too. 

Luckily for me, I will be starting a PhD in a school that &mdash; and this usually goes largely unsaid &mdash; teaches you plenty of theoretical concepts. I will be learning a lot of theories going forward. My aim will be to apply them. Within the comp bio field, I plan to do research in statistical genetics, which is, well, very theoretical. So, there's that. I know some statistics, basic statistics, and this should be enough to propel me to learn complex concepts. 

The next few years will be interesting but tiresome. But I will live, you'll see. At the end, I will come out a more-rounded scientist, and a brilliant one too.

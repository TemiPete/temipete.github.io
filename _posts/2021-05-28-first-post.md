Here's me, opening the door into a cave of thoughts and musings. I hope to write constantly, developing this ability in the process. 
My thoughts will be posted here. If you want to read up on projects, there is a separate page for that. 

In a few months, I will be starting a PhD. *Surreal. Right?*. And I will be starting a PhD in the amazing field of genetics, and at the awesome UChicago. I have worked years to get to this point and I intend to make the most of it. Most of the years spent after earning my bachelors were to think (and plan) about what I want to do for a career. I knew, in the backend, that I wanted to be a scientist. But coming from where I come from requires good planning and strategy. 

I plan to become a statistical geneticist. Many of my thoughts about the field, I will post on here. These thoughts will be a many, full of errors, but help me track my growth in terms of written communication and development as a scientist.

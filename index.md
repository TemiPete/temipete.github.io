### *about*
My name is Temi, and I'm an incoming PhD student in the Genetics, Genomics and Systems biology ([GGSB](https://ggsb.uchicago.edu/){:target="_blank"}) program at the University of Chicago. Currently, I am completing a master's at the University of North Dakota, supervised by the awesome [Junguk Hur](https://med.und.edu/labs/hur/){:target="_blank"}. 

My research spans using statistics and machine learning to understand biological and genetic data. In coming years, I will be proficient at doing this, and it will be the basis of my career. 

I program fairly well in R and Python. I am getting familiar with Java, to improve my skill set. 

Here is my [cv](../docs/cv.pdf) and a list of my publications.

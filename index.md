### *about*
My name is Temi, and I'm an incoming PhD student in the Genetics, Genomics and Systems biology ([GGSB](https://ggsb.uchicago.edu/){:target="_blank"}) program at the University of Chicago. Currently, I am completing a master's at the University of North Dakota, supervised by the awesome [Junguk Hur](https://med.und.edu/labs/hur/){:target="_blank"}. 

### *research*

My research spans using statistics and machine learning to understand biological and genetic data. In coming years, I will be proficient at doing this, and it will be the basis of my career. 

Here is my [cv](../docs/cv.pdf){:target="_blank"} and a list of [publications](../publications) with my name on them.

### *other things I am interested in*
I play the guitar, and I am interested in Japanese and Middle-eastern/Arabic history and culture. I love Japanese Anime, Chinese Wuxia, and any kind of movie except horror. Also, I regularly do calisthenics training. 

I am learning to speak Japanese at the moment. When I get tired, I'll move on to another language.

    about
  </i></u>
</h3>

My name is Temi, and I'm a PhD student in the Genetics, Genomics and Systems biology ([GGSB](https://ggsb.uchicago.edu/){:target="_blank"}) program at the University of Chicago. A few centuries ago, I completed a master's at the University of North Dakota, supervised by the awesome [Junguk Hur](https://med.und.edu/labs/hur/){:target="_blank"}.

I am interested in using computation to understand genetic data and to improve precision medicine. So, I am actively learning/interested in many areas of statistics and genetics, and machine learning. In coming years, I'll get better at using all of these to answer interesting questions in the field of genetics. Then, and only after, will I be able to graduate with a PhD. I think. 

Here is my <a href="../docs/cv.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cv</a> and a list of <a href="../publications" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">publications</a> that I have contributed to.
